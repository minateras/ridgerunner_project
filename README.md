Ridgerunner Project is a Django project featuring Ridgerunner App, my kennel website. Through this app, I publish kennel-related news, present my dogs, and promote my litters. The site is hosted here: [Kennel Messenger Dog](https://www.ridgerunner.se "Kennel Messenger Dog").

Ridgerunner Project also features a site where I provide information and statistics about Swedish rhodesian ridgebacks active in dog sports. The goal is to promote the use of these dogs in breeding over dogs that only have merits from dog shows. The site is hosted here: [Svenska* Arbetande Rhodesian Ridgebacks](https://www.ridgerunner.se/workingridge_app "Svenska* Arbetande Rhodesian Ridgebacks").
