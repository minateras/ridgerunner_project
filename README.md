# README

Ridgerunner Project is a Django project featuring Ridgerunner App, my kennel website. Through this app, I publish kennel-related news, present my dogs, and promote my litters. The site is hosted here: TBA.

Another app is currently under development and will, in time, be added to this project. In this app I will provide information and statistics about rhodesian ridgebacks active in dog sports. The goal is to promote the use of these dogs in breeding over dogs that only have merits from dog shows.
